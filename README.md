# SPINNER_refactoring
SPINNER(Structure Prediction of Inorganic crystals using Neural Network potentials with Evolutionary and Random searches)

If you use SPINNER, please cite this paper: S. Kang et al. Accelerated identification of equilibrium structures of multicomponent inorganic crystals using machine learning potentials (npj Comput. Mater. 8, 108, (2022)).

## Installation

### Virtual environment
SPINNER utilize not only SPINNER source but also many other packages such as randspg, LAMMPS, SIMPLE-NN, and AMP2.
So, we highly recommand to use virtual environment such as Anaconda.
After install Anaconda, create virtual environment for SPINNER and activate the environment.
```
  conda create -n SPINNER python=3.9
  conda activate SPINNER
```

### Download SPINNER
```
git clone https://github.com/MDIL-SNU/SPINNER.git
```

### Python requirements

SPINNER supports Python `3.6` or higher version. SPINNER utilizes Python modules in the following:

  - mpi4py (https://bitbucket.org/mpi4py/mpi4py/)
  - PyYAML (https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/)
  - numpy (1.x.x version) (https://numpy.org/)
  - pybind11 (https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/)

You can download these modules by

```
  pip3 install mpi4py PyYAML numpy==1.26.4 pybind11
```

or directly downloading the source codes from the webpages.

Following packages are required to use SIMPLE-NN and AMP2

  - PyTorch (https://pytorch.org/)
  - spglib (https://github.com/spglib/spglib)


### C++ compilers

SPINNER supports CMAKE 3.20 or higher version and gcc version 7.3.1 or higer version.

### Python binding of randSpg and LAMMPS (important)
SPINNER utilizes python binding of randSpg (https://github.com/xtalopt/randSpg) and LAMMPS code (https://www.lammps.org). However, those codes are slightly modified to be incorporated with SPINNER, so you need to comiple with source codes provided in this page, not with the original ones.

### Install randSpg
To install randSpg, do

```
  cd /SPINNER-directory/randSpg-vspinner/
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make -j3
```

to bind randSpg with python, do 

```
  cd /SPINNER-directory/randSpg-vspinner/python
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make –j3
  cp pyrandspg.cpython* /directory-where-your-python-is/lib/python3/site-packages/
```

(FAQ) if error occur during cmake process, try

```
  cd /SPINNER-directory/randSpg-vspinner/python
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake .. -D Pybind11=/VIRTUAL_ENV_DIR/lib/python3.9/site-packeges/pybind11/share/cmake/pybind11/ 
  make –j3
  cp pyrandspg.cpython* /directory-where-your-python-is/lib/python3/site-packages/
```

### Install LAMMPS
This is the most tricky part of the installation steps. You can install python-lammps by following steps below but it may not work depending on your environment. Please look into LAMMPS forum (https://www.lammps.org/forum.html) or LAMMPS manual Ch. 2 (https://docs.lammps.org/Python_run.html) for detailed discussion.

First, download stable version of LAMMPS from LAMMPS github (https://github.com/lammps/lammps.git)
We lastly tested on 2Aug2023 version.

```
  git clone -b stable https://github.com/lammps/lammps.git lammps-spinner
```

SPINNER provide two version of LAMMPS, Normal and SIMD. Install process is different for each version. Check your machine and follow the install process that match with your machine.

#### 1. Normal version
Copy pair potential code of SIMPLE-NN to LAMMPS src

```
  cp /SPINNER-directory/spinner/simple_nn/features/symmetry_function/pair_nn_simd.* /LAMMPS-directory/src/
  cp /SPINNER-directory/spinner/simple_nn/features/symmetry_function/symmetry_function.h /LAMMPS-directory/src/
```

```
  cd /LAMMPS-directory/
  cd src
  make yes-python
  make XXX mode=shlib
  make install-python
```

Here, XXX is the name of the make file (Makefile.XXX in src/MAKE directory). Note that LAMMPS have to be installed with serial version (not mpi version). The optimization is recommended for your system but default serial option is likely to be sufficient.

To check whether LAMMPS install in python, run the following code in python.

```
from lammps import lammps
lmp = lammps()
```

#### 2. SIMD version
If your machine support SIMD, we recommend to use SIMD version. It speeds up around 2 times faster than normal version.

```
  cp /SPINNER-directory/spinner/simple_nn/features/symmetry_function/SIMD/pair_nn_simd.* /LAMMPS-directory/src/
  cp /SPINNER-directory/spinner/simple_nn/features/symmetry_function/symmetry_function.h /LAMMPS-directory/src/
```

```
  cd /LAMMPS-directory/
  cp cmake/preset/oneapi.cmake cmake/preset/my_oneapi.cmake 
```

find the below line and add "-xAVX" tag in the cmake/preset/my_opeapi.cmake

```
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE "-O3 -DNDEBUG -xAVX" CACHE STRING "" FORCE)
```

```
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -D PKG_PYTHON=yes -D PKG_EXTRA-COMPUTE=yes -D PKG_INTEL=yes -D BUILD_MPI=no \
  -D LAMMPS_MACHINE=simd_serial  -D INTEL_ARCH=cpu -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=yes  \
  -D  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  -C ../cmake/presets/nolib.cmake  -C ../cmake/presets/my_oneapi.cmake \
  -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/VIRTUAL_ENV_DIR/ ../cmake/
  cmake --build . --target install
  cmake --build . --target install-python
```

To check whether LAMMPS install in python, run the following code in python.

```
from lammps import lammps
lmp = lammps('simd_serial')
```

### Finalize installation

Other packages are automatically installed by running the bellow command.

```
  cd /SPINNER-directory/
  pip install .
```

## Usage

## 1. Running only SPINNER code (crystal structure prediction part)

Check the examples in the /SPINNER-directory/examples/csp directory.

To use SPINNER, 1 file (XXX.yaml) and 1 directories (input directory and src) are required.

### input file (XXX.yaml; XXX is named by the user)
Parameter list to control SPINNER code is listed in XXX.yaml. 
The simplest form of input.yaml is described below:
```YAML
# XXX.yaml

  input_dir:        input_directory_name
  output_dir:       output_directory_name
  initial_volume:   326.0
  structure:
      generation: 400
  material:
      Li:  4
      Hf:  2
      N:   4
```

### input directory
In input directory (input_dir: in input file), LAMMPS potential file should be located. (Potential file have to be named potential.) Potential should be SIMPLE-NN format (https://github.com/MDIL-SNU/SIMPLE-NN).


### Running code

```
  mpirun -np core_number spinner_csp XXX.yaml
```

## 2. Running whole steps in serial (from DFT MD to crystal structure prediction)

Check the examples in the /SPINNER-directory/examples/serial_run directory.

To use serial mode, 1 file (total.yaml) are required.

### input file (total.yaml)
Parameter list to control whole process code is listed in total.yaml. 
Check detail parameters in /SPINNER-directory/examples/serial_run/total.yaml.

### Running code

```
  # DFT melt-quench MD
  spinner_auto_md -np core_number total.yaml

  # NNP training with SIMPLE-NN package
  spinner_nnp_train total.yaml

  # Make yaml file for csp
  configure_csp total.yaml configs/

  # Crystal structure prediction with SPINNER
  mpirun -np core_number spinner_csp configs/final_spinner.yaml
```
